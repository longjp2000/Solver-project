c\Name: dsgets

c\Description:
c  Given the eigenvalues of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix H,
c  computes the NP shifts AMU that are zeros of the polynomial of
c  degree NP which filters out components of the unwanted eigenvectors
c  corresponding to the AMU's based on some given criteria.

c  NOTE: This is called even in the case of user specified shifts in
c  order to sort the eigenvalues, and error bounds of H for later use.

c\Usage:
c  call dsgets
c     ( ISHIFT, WHICH, KEV, NP, RITZ, BOUNDS, SHIFTS )

c\Arguments
c  ISHIFT  Integer.  (INPUT)
c          Method for selecting the implicit shifts at each iteration.
c          ISHIFT = 0: user specified shifts
c          ISHIFT = 1: exact shift with respect to the matrix H.

c  WHICH   Character*2.  (INPUT)
c          Shift selection criteria.
c          'LM' -> KEV eigenvalues of largest magnitude are retained.
c          'SM' -> KEV eigenvalues of smallest magnitude are retained.
c          'LA' -> KEV eigenvalues of largest value are retained.
c          'SA' -> KEV eigenvalues of smallest value are retained.
c          'BE' -> KEV eigenvalues, half from each end of the spectrum.
c                  If KEV is odd, compute one more from the high end.

c  KEV      Integer.  (INPUT)
c          KEV+NP is the size of the matrix H.

c  NP      Integer.  (INPUT)
c          Number of implicit shifts to be computed.

c  RITZ    Double precision array of length KEV+NP.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
c          On INPUT, RITZ contains the eigenvalues of H.
c          On OUTPUT, RITZ are sorted so that the unwanted eigenvalues
c          are in the first NP locations and the wanted part is in
c          the last KEV locations.  When exact shifts are selected, the
c          unwanted part corresponds to the shifts to be applied.

c  BOUNDS  Double precision array of length KEV+NP.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
c          Error bounds corresponding to the ordering in RITZ.

c  SHIFTS  Double precision array of length NP.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
c          On INPUT:  contains the user specified shifts if ISHIFT = 0.
c          On OUTPUT: contains the shifts sorted into decreasing order
c          of magnitude with respect to the Ritz estimates contained in
c          BOUNDS. If ISHIFT = 0, SHIFTS is not modified on exit.
