c\Name: dsconv

c\Description:
c  Convergence testing for the symmetric Arnoldi eigenvalue routine.

c\Usage:
c  call dsconv
c     ( N, RITZ, BOUNDS, TOL, NCONV )

c\Arguments
c  N       Integer.  (INPUT)
c          Number of Ritz values to check for convergence.

c  RITZ    Double precision array of length N.  (INPUT)
c          The Ritz values to be checked for convergence.

c  BOUNDS  Double precision array of length N.  (INPUT)
c          Ritz estimates associated with the Ritz values in RITZ.

c  TOL     Double precision scalar.  (INPUT)
c          Desired relative accuracy for a Ritz value to be considered
c          "converged".

c  NCONV   Integer scalar.  (OUTPUT)
c          Number of "converged" Ritz values.
