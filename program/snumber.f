c     Purpose: Number nodes in component of graph for small profile and
c              rms wavefront

c     Input:
c     ------

c     n      - number of nodes in graph
c     nc     - number of nodes in component of graph
c     snode  - node at which numbering starts
c     lstnum - count of nodes which have already been numbered
c     e2     - twice tne number of edges in graph = xadj(n+1)-1
c     adj    - adjacency list for all nodes in graph
c            - list of length 2e where e is number of edges in
c              graph and 2e = xadj(n+1)-1
c     xadj   - index vector for adj
c            - nodes adjacent to node i are found in adj(j), where
c              j = xadj(i), xadj(i)+1, ..... , xadj(i+1)-1
c     s      - list giving distance of each node in this
c              component from end node
c     q      - list of nodes which are in this component
c            - also used to store queue of active or preactive nodes
c     p      - undefined

c     Output:
c     -------

c     n      - unchanged
c     nc     - unchanged
c     snode  - unchanged
c     lstnum - count of numbered nodes (input value incremented by nc)
c     e2     - unchanged
c     adj    - unchanged
c     xadj   - unchanged
c     s      - list of new node numbers
c            - new number for node i is s(i)
c     q      - not used
c     p      - not used

c     Notes:
c     ------

c     s also serves as list giving status of nodes during numbering process:

c     s(i) gt 0 indicates node i is postactive
c     s(i) =  0 indicates node i is active
c     s(i) = -1 indicates node i is preactive
c     s(i) = -2 indicates node i is inactive

c     p is used to hold priorities for each node
