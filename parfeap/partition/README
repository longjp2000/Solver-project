To use: compile the partition program and run

  mpirun -np 2 partition npartitions Ifile [graphfile]

The output file will consist of:
  - The processor assignment for each node (numnp)
  - The pointer array for the nodal graph (numnp+1)
  - The adjacency lists for the nodal graph

If the graph file name is not given explicitly, we make a file of the
form path + "graph.foo" for an input file path + "Ifoo".
